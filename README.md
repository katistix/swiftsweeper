## SwiftSweeper

SwiftSweeper is a **vibe-coded** MacOS minesweeper game written in Swift with SwiftUI. It is a simple and fun game that allows you to play minesweeper on your Mac.

### What's Vibe-Coding?

Here's a video by [The Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) reacting to the original video by YCombinator where the term was coined.

My opinion on *vibe coding* is that while yes, coding using AI gives you an advantage in terms of speed, it is and **will not be**, for a long time, a replacement for genuine human skill when it comes to Software Engineering. It is a tool that can help you get there faster, but it is not a replacement for the knowledge and experience that comes with years of practice.
